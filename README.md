# Color-detection-
This is a Machine learning project in which we predict the colors from an image using opencv library
Here we read the Image using cv2 library from opencv then we read the datatset using pandas library 
We created two functions one is to calculate the minimum displacement from the actual RGB colours and then check the closest values from the dataset
Second function is to find out the actual position of mouse pointer to get the x and y co ordinates of the colour to calculate the distance as we know that all the colours are made up of primary three colours i.e. Red , Blue and Green
At last we created a loop to create a rectangle to show the colour and its corresponding RGB values on the line
